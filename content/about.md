Hello there! I'm Prabhpreet "Prabh" - a Software Engineer passionate about building backend
software solutions. My journey has taken me through the Platform Engineering department, where I had
the opportunity to work on several exciting projects.

In my 3+ years of full-time experience, I've built and developed server-side software like Tenant Management, Identity and Access Management suites (User Management, Authentication,
Authorization, API Authentication, and Data Access Control Lists). I also worked on Stateful Data
Processing Applications, which helped me develop a deeper understanding of the intricacies of data
management.

Lately, I've been diving into the world of Artificial Intelligence with projects like Insights
Pipelines, Agents, RAG applications, and Unified Assistants for software products. If you're curious
to learn more about my work or want to connect on [LinkedIn]({{< param "GlobalValues.linkedin" >}}), feel free to reach out!

If you'd like to get involved in any of the GitHub projects I'm working on or have feedback on my code,
please don't hesitate to raise a GitHub issue. Your contributions are always welcome!
