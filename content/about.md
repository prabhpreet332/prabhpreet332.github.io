Hi there, I am Prabhpreet "Prabh" and I am a Software Engineer. I have work on Backend Software.

In my past full time experience I have worked in Platform Engineering department where I worked on building multiple server-side software like Tenant Management, Identity and Access Management suite (User Management, Authentication, Authorization; API Auth; Data Access Control Lists) and Stateful Data Processing Applications.

More recently, I have been working on building the AI Software - Insights Pipelines, Agents, RAG applications, Unified Assistants for the Software Products.
